I've created a simple bash script to convert mkv to mp4 container quickly. The script will allow you to batch convert multiple mkv files or convert one at a time depending on your needs. You can also append a subtitle srt file to your mp4 files with this tool.

## **Fast Conversion**

When it comes to mkv and mp4, they are just containers for the actual video and audio data. What this means is that you do not need to re-encode which can take very long depending on the mkv file size. If you simply convert the mkv to mp4 container you maintain the same quality and it's done within a few seconds to 1-2 minutes depending on the mkv file size.

## **Why Convert**

There can be a few reasons for converting mkv to mp4 files. The mp4 container has much more compatibility across different platforms. For example, the old playstation 3 does not support mkv files, so you can simply convert them to mp4 using this script. This allows you to play all your files on the playstation without spending lots of time re-encoding.

## **Usage**

Tested on ubuntu & manjaro

1. Place your mkv files in the the **input** folder.
2. Optional: Place srt files in the **srt** folder.
3. Now execute the script in a terminal as follows:
   {{< highlight bash >}}./mkv2mp4{{< /highlight >}}
4. Your mp4 converted files will be in the **output** folder.
