If you need to unpack and repack boot.img, recovery.img, or loki images, then this is the tool for you. With mktool you don't need to enter any commands. You simply place your image files in the input folder and choose from the menu options. It's the perfect tool for modifying images quickly and easily. Mktool is very simple to use and can accommodate both beginners and advanced users.
