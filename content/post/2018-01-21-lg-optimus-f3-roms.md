The LG Optimus F3 ROMs really enhance the user experience and make this device much more ejoyable. Aside from the usual deodex, debloating, and zipaligning, Xperion rom adds other elements that otherwise do not come in the factory rom. The Xperion theme that comes with the rom is quite a nice touch.
