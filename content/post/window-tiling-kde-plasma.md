Many users are not aware that KDE Plasma has built in window tiling functionality. Window tiling in KDE Plasma actually works quite well, though it's not meant to compete with window managers that are exclusively for window tiling. Nevertheless, you'd be surprised at how well it works.

<!--more-->

After discovering window tiling in KDE Plasma I have not felt the need for a tiling window manager. If all you need is half tiling and quarter tiling, then KDE's built in tiling should fit your needs.

Lets take a look at how to use window tiling in KDE Plasma.

## **Setup Window Tiling In KDE Plasma**

**Half Tiling:**

To activate half tiling, hold the super key and press any of the arrow keys.

**Quarter tiling:**

To activate quarter tiling, hold the super key and press an arrow key followed by another arrow key in quick succession. For example, if you want to tile a window to the upper right, hold the super key and press the up arrow quickly followed by the right arrow.

**Deactivate tiling:**

To return a window to its original size before activating tiling, hold the super key and press the right arrow key until the window is back to normal.

## **Conclusion**

So that's window tiling in KDE Plasma. If you don't need advanced window tiling or don't wish to setup a window tiling manager, then KDE has got you covered with half and quarter tiling.
