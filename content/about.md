# Welcome to techStop

My name is Antonio, but most know me by my developer or web name “GameTheory”. I’ve been creating customizations and apps for android for some time now. My computer operating system of choice is GNU Linux, specifically, <a href="https://manjaro.org/" target="_blank">Manjaro</a> KDE edition. Most, if not all OS related material will be linux based.

I created this blog site to share my experiences with android and linux and perhaps we can also talk about other tech together. I will be sharing what I have learned and created along with tutorials and source code. There will be a comment area in post pages for those that would like to engage in the conversation, provide suggestions, or even help others.

I hope that you find techStop useful and that we can learn together to expand our knowledge in the areas this site covers.
