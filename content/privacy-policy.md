## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to us. At techStop we have a few fundamental principles that we follow:

- We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
- We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
- We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our site.

It is techStop’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, techStop collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. techStop’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how techStop’s visitors use its website.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. techStop uses cookies to help techStop identify visitors, their usage of techStop website, and their website access preferences. techStop visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using techStop’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of techStop’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Google Ads

Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google’s use of cookies enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site or other sites on the internet. Users may opt-out of personalized ads by visiting the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a> page.

## Google Analytics

We have implemented the following:

- Remarketing with Google Analytics
- Google Display Network Impression Reporting
- Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting

We use Google Analytics to collect information about use of this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" target="_blank">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a> and the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">disabling cookies</a> on your browser.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, techStop may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in techStop’s sole discretion. techStop encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
